<h1>Frontend Development Challenge</h1>

<p>This is the assignment I got from <b>Fyle</b> for frontend engineer internship</p>

<p>It is about workout tracker that tracks you workout of different typed and store it in grid table ans show in chart</p>

<p>I have udes <b>Angular Material UI</b> library for inputs and grid table and <b>Prime NG</b> for chart</p>

<p>The sample data was given to store first but I was not able handle it with data fron input so I did not include that</p>

<P>At end it was fun to do this assignment</p>

<h2>Thanks to Fyle for this opportunity.</h2>
